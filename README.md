# Introduction

Repository for final project in the course "Heuristics and Metaheuristics" (FEUP, 2024-2025)

The goal is to apply heuristics to tasks within image classification.

There are two components:

- **Feature selection:** find redundant features in the latent space induced by the CNN-based feature extractor
- **Model pruning:** find redundant parameters in a trained model
